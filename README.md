Flatstrap
=========

This is a work-in-progress Flat UI "inspiried" theme for Bootstrap, but in 100% less (as it should be).

Clone Flatstrap, change into the directory and clone Bootstrap.

	git clone git@github.com:niallobrien/flatstrap.git
	cd flatstrap
	git clone git://github.com/twitter/bootstrap.git

It currently looks like this:
![Flatstrap](http://dl.dropbox.com/u/14373373/Screenshots/1v.png?raw=true)

When compiling the less files yourself, simply compile /flatstrap.less and it should import all it needs.

Enjoy! :)

Niall.
